# Exploratory Data Analysis of Road Accidents in the United Kingdom

### Description

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aims to examine the occurrence of accidents on UK roads, focusing on identifying patterns and potential causes. The analysis was conducted using a dataset containing information on location (latitude and longitude), severity, and other relevant accident factors.

### Project Objectives

- Explore and visualize the geographical distribution of road accidents in the UK.

- Investigate possible variables related to factors that may influence accident occurrences, such as time of day, weather conditions, and accident types.

- Create a dynamic heatmap to illustrate areas with high accident concentrations using geographical coordinates.

- Generate charts and analyses to facilitate data understanding and support decision-making.

### Tools and Libraries Used

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For graphical data visualization.

Folium and GeoPandas: For creating the heatmap and geospatial analysis.

OS: For file handling and system commands.

### Heatmap Visualization

The interactive heatmap generated with the Folium library is not rendered directly on GitHub because this type of content requires dynamic execution. To overcome this limitation, the heatmap has been saved as an HTML file, which can be viewed separately in a web browser.

To access the heatmap, open the file: heatmap.html

Alternatively, you can run the notebook locally to generate and view the heatmap dynamically.

### Next Steps

Organize the code into separate files for preprocessing and plotting functions.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local environment:

git clone https://github.com/bernardobadc/analise-de-acidentes-rodovias-UK.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook or scripts to view the analyses and charts.

### Conclusions and Insights

Through exploratory analysis, high-accident concentration zones were identified, along with patterns suggesting that factors such as time of day and weather conditions play a significant role in accident occurrences. The generated charts and maps are valuable tools for visualizing these patterns and can contribute to preventive actions and road safety planning.
